# SpinStat bike computer 

Welcome to the repository for the Open-Source Bike Computer 'SpinStat' project!
This project aims to create an open, customizable, and modular bike computer.
Whether youâ€™re an enthusiast or a developer, we invite you to collaborate, contribute, and make this project better!

## Development
### Software

To get started with software development take a look at [Development](./DEV.md).

### Hardware

Hardware development is still an open topic, as soon as there is actual progress it can be found [here](https://github.com/SpinStat/Hardware).

## Current State

The current plans are the STM32H7, a u-blox GNSS and a Bosch BNO055. Zephyre is the choice of RTOS for now.

### Features Planned:
- **Battery Module:** Modular battery packs that can be easily swapped out, each equipped with a balancing board, allowing you to carry multiple charged packs for extended trips.
- **Button Interface & Tactile Scroll Wheel:** Physical buttons for user interaction, potentially including a tactile scroll wheel (inspired by devices like the Apple Watch or Suunto watches) for a smoother cycling experience.
- **Mapping & Navigation:** OpenStreetMap integration for pre-planned routes with on-device routing planned for future updates.
- **Connectivity:** Support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth hopefully at some point ANT+
- **Additional Integrations:** Weather data, phone app syncing, and other features may be integrated as the project progresses.

### Ideas and Features in Consideration:
- **Flashlight:** Phone-like flashlight, just becourse it is usefull.
- **Touchscreen and Physical Controls:** My personal preference is to have as many physical buttons as possible, but i do see the appeal of a touchscreen.
