# TI SOM

Everything in a package, but need about 4w max., which is a lot

Advantage: 
 - I don't have to designe the RAM interface, which is has caused me mayor headaches so far.
 - "Plug and Play", its as close as i will get to not have to debug any hardware.

Disadvantage: 
 - Expensive (~80â‚¬)
 - High powerdraw (3W)
 - not suuper small, but also, i probably can't get it smaller myself
